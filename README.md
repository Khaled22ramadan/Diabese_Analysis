# Diabese_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a diabetes dataset to gain insights into the factors that contribute to diabetes. The dataset includes various features such as the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome (whether the person has diabetes or not).
